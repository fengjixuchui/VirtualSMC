[$Num] type [ui8 ] 75693820 len [ 1] attr [D0] -> ATTR_FUNCTION|ATTR_WRITE|ATTR_READ
smc-count
This returns the actual number of SMC devices on read, and allows setting [$Adr] key
on write with the argument seem to being a SMC index.
Currently always returns 1 on read.
Currently only 0 parameter is supported on write, anything else returns SmcBadParameter.
With 0 passed [$Adr] will be set to 0x300, yet it is 0x300 by default.

AC adapter number of ports
Present in new SMC only. Defines the availability of new AC-prefixed keys (e.g. AC-W).


[AC-W] type [si8 ] 73693820 len [ 1] attr [90] -> ATTR_FUNCTION|ATTR_READ

- kACCommEnableBit 45   // 1 bit, doesn't contain meaningful information
- kACSourceIdBit   44   // 3 bits, check against non-zero to determine format version

Hard-drive Backup Key Password
Contains 128-bit (higher 16 bytes are currently unused) session key used to unwrap encrypted HDD volumes.
This is a direct copy of IOHibernateSMCVariables value. Could be restored from RTC via AppleBds.efi (see rtcread.c).
Read and immediatelly overwritten by boot.efi durning HDD unwrap for FV2 (e.g. for updates/authenticated restart).
Written at the following cases by AppleSMC.kext:
- via registerPrioritySleepWakeInterest when it receives kIOMessageSystemWillRestart (0xE0000310):
  this is used by sudo fdesetup authrestart and the value is written from IOHibernateSMCVariables ioreg property;
- via setPowerState method when it receives kPowerOff (0x0):
  this is used to erase HBKP value upon shutting down macOS.
It appears that SMC firmware erases it as well after certain amount of time (set by NATJ?).

[WKTP] type [ui8 ] 75693820 len [ 1] attr [D0] -> ATTR_FUNCTION|ATTR_WRITE|ATTR_READ
Wake Power Type
Power nap state bit mask, accepts and reports the following values:
0  = Fully awake
1  = In Silent Run / Power Nap
2  = In Sleep, Silent Run / Power Nap are allowed
Equal to [MSQC] lower 4 bits.
Key presence implies Power Nap (silent run) availability.


===========================
Hidden Keys:


[KPPW] type [ch8*] 6368382A len [32] attr [50] -> ATTR_FUNCTION|ATTR_WRITE
Kernel Protection Password
Pass [SpecialisRevelio] to succeed and enable more complete read mode for old SMC.
Pass [SMC The place to be, definitely!] to do the same for new SMC.


[KPST] type [ui8 ] 75693820 len [ 1] attr [80] -> ATTR_READ
Kernel Protection Status
Set to 1 if [KPPW] succeeds. After reading any invalid key KPST is reset to 0.
1. By default [MACR] only reads from EPM area. With [KPST] set to 1 [MACM] could read
- RAM Data, RAM Stack, FF2000 Reserved for old SMC
- RAM for new SMC
2. This value also affects reading and writing abilties of certain keys:
attr &= ~ATTR_CONST;
if ((attr & ATTR_PRIVATE_READ) && KPST == 0  && (EPCI & 0xFF00) == 0xF000)
   attr &= ~ATTR_READ;
if ((attr & ATTR_PRIVATE_WRITE) && KPST == 0 && (EPCI & 0xFF00) == 0xF000)
   attr &= ~ATTR_WRITE;
If an invalid attempt is made SmcNotReadable (0x85) or SmcNotWritable (0x86) are ported.

[OSK1] type [ch8*] 6368382A len [32] attr [90] -> ATTR_FUNCTION|ATTR_READ
